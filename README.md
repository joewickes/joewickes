# Hi there, I'm Joe! 👋🏼

I'm a Full Stack Developer that uses my experience in construction, art direction, and IT to write software in React, Express, and PostgreSQL. I have a passion for thinking on my feet and working on close-knit teams that are challenged daily!

## 🔍 About me
My name is Joe and I am a Full Stack Web Developer in the Tampa, FL area with a background in construction, art direction, and IT. I really enjoy working with JavaScript, and am continually trying to hone my skills and learn more about different technologies associated with the programming language of the internet.

One of the things that I love most about this field is the inundation of passion and collaboration that so many professionals share. Because of that unqiue combination, software often seems to be evolving and growing at a much higher rate than other fields. I am continually impressed with open-source resources and look to contribute in the future.

## 🌱 Learning
I'm currently learning:
- Redux to expand my knowledge of state containment beyond React's Context technology (using Stephen Grider's Udemy course, Modern React with Redux [2020])
- VIM so that I can make use of a lightweight text-editor from virtually any command-line
- Linux so that I can grow in my understanding of (and contributions to) cyber-security and a ton of open-source tech
